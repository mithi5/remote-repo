It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong
But the strength I have is washing away
It wont be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
